    "Nach der manuellen Bewertung der generierten Gegenreden enthält der Datensatz nun mehrere Spalten, die die Bewertungen der unterschiedlichen Aspekte der Gegenreden abbilden. Dazu gehören `Empathiefaktor`, `Faktentreue`, `Ton`, `Klarheit der Argumentation` und `erfolgreicher Einsatz von Storytelling-Elementen`. Jeder dieser Aspekte wurde auf einer Skala von 1 bis 5 bewertet, um eine quantitative Analyse der qualitativen Merkmale zu ermöglichen. Im Folgenden wird ein Ausschnitt der bewerteten Tabelle präsentiert."
