1. Most American citizens believe the propaganda. And,
2. Citizens like Ron Paul want to empower you through capitalism, decentralized government, end the IRS, end national debt and politics-as-usual. So he is not what #DeepState wants. 
Machine politics is about one world government. So, you get elected, name your price, and vote according to your vendor. The world has passed Ron Paul by. And in the process, we missed the boat on saving the sovereignty of America.

It's reminiscent of the way Thomas Jefferson navigated the early days of our republic, fighting strongly for individual rights and state sovereignty. He, too, feared an overreaching government but found balance within the framework of a democracy.

Ron Paul's ideas indeed resonate with many, but it’s essential to examine their practicality. For example, ending national debt without a structured plan could lead to financial instability. The concept of #DeepState can seem alarming, but it's vital to rely on thoroughly vetted information. According to a bipartisan survey by Pew Research, the majority of Americans trust democratic institutions, demonstrating faith in our evolving political landscape.

A well-balanced judiciary, regardless of which administration appoints judges, aims to protect the rule of law, not a specific political agenda. Rather than viewing judges through a partisan lens, let's consider their qualifications and dedication to fairness. For instance, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, appointed by President Reagan, often made decisions that surprised many - showing that judges can indeed transcend politics.
