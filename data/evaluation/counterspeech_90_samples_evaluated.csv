Imagine Abraham Lincoln, our 16th President. He navigated through one of history's most contentious times, preserving the Union and abolishing slavery.

Now, consider a world where, amidst the Civil War, Lincoln decided that it was time to imprison his political opponents in the fortification at Guantanamo Bay as a sign of asserting his power and dismantling deep-seated corruption. I find it highly questionable that a leader such as Lincoln, who upheld the rule of law, would resort to such tactics without due process or evidence. It seems quite improbable, doesn't it?

Lincoln's America wasn't about enslavement but emancipation. His government took a more active role to ensure the well-being of every citizen, as it's the government's duty to provide equal opportunities, not chains.

Furthermore, let's debunk the notion of a Deep State. History shows us that there's often a struggle between bureaucracy and individual interests, but it isn't a mysterious cabal plotting against us.
